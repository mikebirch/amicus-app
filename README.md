# Paulus application skeleton

A skeleton for building simple websites with the [Paulus PHP framwork](https://github.com/mikebirch/paulus-php)

This skeleton includes a blog and pages for a simple website.

If your website needs a CMS, Paulus can be used with the headless CMS [Directus](https://directus.io/) which connects to your database and provides an intuitive admin app for managing its content.
